Marylin pen-drawing 695x866.jpeg

Defalt size is 70mm, so rescale 570% (factor 5.7=400mm)

Printed Marylin pen-drawing 695x866.jpeg as ~30cm tall on 2 pages (do it with Paint, other tools can't do that incl Gimp)

Redrew lower part of face by hand with a black fineliner on see-through paper

Scanned my pen-drawing at 600 dpi (1200 dpi didn't improve much)

Gimp:
 - removed artifacts with brush
 - fill bucket with threshold .. px. On outside of picture, but also inside larger areas. This is to improve contrast between lines (supposed black) and background (supposed white)
 - enlarge image (scale) to 133%
 - make BW using levels (value 160)
 - filters->enhance->despeckle: Adaptive on, Radius 2, black level -1, white level 255
 - export as jpg (Pen-rvg-Marylin-lower part-600dpi BW despeckled....jpg)
evt:
 -Filters->Edge-Detect->Sobel: Mode_Difference, opacity 70, daarna:
 -COlors->Levels input:56 output:200 clamp 1.00

Inkscape
 - trace bitmap: mode brightness cutoff, threshold 0.60, speckles 18, smooth corners 0, optimise 0
 - select all nodes, Path->Simplify to reduce nodes
 - check amount of nodes: select all nodes, Object properties shows "Nodes: ~4000"
 - select in layers only the generated path
 - then export selection to Plain SVG:
   (Pen-rvg-Marylin-lower part-600dpi-BW despeckled-brightness cutoff 0.6 0 0 0 simplified.svg)

Although loading into Tinkercad does stil not work, the .svg CAN be loaded into PrusaSlicer :-)
