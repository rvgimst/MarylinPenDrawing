Use Gimp to improve image and make fully B/W:
-make greyscale
	-do either Image->Mode->Greyscale or
	-Colors->Saturation->Set scape to 0
-sharpen image
	-Filters->Enhance->Sharpen
	-settings radius ~14, amount ~10, threshold 0.0
-make B/W
	-Color->Levels->Adjust both (B/W) input levels to a value around 170
	-Input levels values should differ only 1 to enforce 2 colors (B/W)
-There will be some artefacts (spickles). Clean them by painting them white
	-paintbrush-?>
-export to png - no compression

Start InkScape
	-Quick Setup->light background
	-Time to draw->New document
	-File->Open->load png file->standard settings (don't use Import. Strangely enough it doesn't place the bitmap on the canvas but on the side and much smaller...)
	-Path->Trace bitmap. Still playing with settings. best till now: 
	 -autotrace, filter iterations 0, error threshold 0, speckles 0, smooth corners 0, optimise 0
	
OR:
-load pen-drawing 695x866.jpeg directly in InScape
--Path->Trace bitmap. Brightness cutoff->threshold 0.654, speckles 0, smooth corners 0, Optimise 0
