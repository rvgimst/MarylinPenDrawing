Marylin pen-drawing 695x866.jpeg

Printed Marylin pen-drawing 695x866.jpeg as ~30cm tall on 2 pages (do it with Paint, other tools can't do that incl Gimp)

Redrew by hand with a black fineliner on see-through paper

Scanned my pen-drawing at 600 dpi (1200 dpi didn't improve much)

Gimp:
 - make BW using levels (value ~160)
 - filters->enhance->despeckle: Adaptive on, Radius 2, black level -1, white level 255
 - export as png

Inkscape
 - trace bitmap: mode brightness cutoff, threshold 0.450, speckles 10, smooth corners 0, optimise 0.1
 - select all nodes, Path->Simplify to reduce nodes
 - check amount of nodes: select all nodes, Object properties shows "Nodes: 3963"
 - select in layers only the generated path
 - then export selection to Plain SVG

File reduced size (compared to non-simplified version) from 3MB to 200kB with 4000nodes
However, loading into Tinkercad does stil NOT work :-(
Cutting the image to a smaller part with ~650 nodes worked! :-)
