Inkscape
--------
-Between 26oct and 16nov24 I have been tracing by hand/mouse in Inkscape the scanned pen drawing (600dpi) on a size of 40x32cm (hxw)
-[TODO: here the part fon how to cut the upper boundary of the drawing in Inkscape]
-Exported lower part of hand traced vectors to Plain svg file

Prusa Slicer
------------
-imported .svg into PS
-reduced size overall to 90%, effectively reducing to 36x29cm (hxw)
-thickness of print: 1mm
-Flipped the print to have the front of the print on the print bed
-tested (sliced), printing time 2h
-exported to .stl

Tinkercad
---------
-imported .stl into TC (that worked!)
-added standoff (diam=8mm, h=20mm) with hole diam=4mm on the bottom of the print (dark/dense area)
-exported to .stl with name extended "*-flipped-standoff.stl"

Prusa Slicer
------------
-just a check in PS to see the printing time (2h10m), nothing else

3D printer
----------
-sent .stl file to library printer with comment:
 -please use highest quality/lowest layer thickness
