Inkscape
--------
-Between 16 and 20nov24 I have printed the lower part of the face. Lessons learned:
 -good result regarding the straight lines
 -in order to be able to choose standoffs, the standoff should be 1cm rather than 2cm and then print standoffs of 1 and 0.5cm
 -size ok (90%)
 -thickness should be 2mm instead of 1mm

-Also 20NOV24 I have been tracing further by hand/mouse in Inkscape the left part of the face, still pen drawing (600dpi) on a size of 40x32cm (hxw)
-[TODO: here the part fon how to cut the upper boundary of the drawing in Inkscape]

-Exported lower part of hand traced vectors to Plain svg file
 ->Pen-400mm digital hand trace lower part.svg

Prusa Slicer
------------
-imported .svg into PS
-reduced size to 90%, effectively reducing to 36x29cm (hxw)
-thickness of print: 2mm
-Flipped the print to have the front of the print on the print bed
-tested (sliced), printing time 4h
-exported to .stl
 ->Pen-360mm digital hand trace lower part 2mm-flipped.stl

Tinkercad
---------
-imported .stl into TC (that worked!)
-Check height of face print to be 2mm 
-added standoff (diam=8mm, h=10mm) with hole diam=4mm on the lower part of the print (dark/dense area in the neck)
-exported to .stl
 ->Pen-360mm digital hand trace lower part 2mm-flipped-standoff10.stl

Prusa Slicer
------------
-just a check in PS to see the printing time (4h), nothing else

3D printer
----------
-sent .stl file to library printer with comment:
 -please use highest quality/lowest layer thickness
