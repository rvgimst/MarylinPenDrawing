Inkscape
--------
-Between 16 and 20nov24 I have printed the lower part of the face. Lessons learned:
 -good result regarding the straight lines
 -in order to be able to choose standoffs, the standoff should be 1cm rather than 2cm and then print standoffs of 1 and 0.5cm
 -size ok (90%)
 -thickness/height of 3D print should be 2mm instead of 1mm

-Also 20NOV24 I have been tracing further by hand/mouse in Inkscape the left part of the face, still pen drawing (600dpi) on a size of 40x32cm (hxw)

Export to Plain SVG
-Exported lower part of hand traced vectors to Plain svg file
 ->Pen-400mm digital hand trace lower part.svg
-always export selection, otherwise the file gets very big

-16NOV25 Creating the cutlines
(also see Test linecut in length-division.svg). The object needs to be 3D printed in 3 parts: left, right, bottom parts of the face. 3 Cutlines (red & orange in the svg) have been drawn to define the 3 parts. The cutlines are drawn exactly through the middle of the boundary stroke (Let's call this the boundary edge). 
The idea is to slice the boundary edge length in half and print them each one as part of its face part. This way when the 3 fase parts are glued, the boundary edges perfectly fit together and together have the exact same width as all other triangle sides (=1mm).
How to slice with cutlines:
 -duplicate the cutline (you will need it multiple times)
 -make sure cutlines are on top (object->raise to top)
 -select the boundary edge (this is still a stroke)
 -path->stroke to path (this converts the stroke to a contour path)
 -select 1 cutline and the boundary edge (which is a path now)
 -path->division (this breaks the boundary edge in half, and removes the cutline)
 -now select ALL strokes (triangles, polygons and fill patterns) that overlap the boundary edge
 -path->stroke to path, and WITHOUT deselecting the objects:
 -path->Combine (don't use Union, this is for 2 objects only)
 -remove the cut-off parts outside the boundary

Prusa Slicer
------------
-import .svg into PS
-reduced size to 90%, effectively reducing to 36x29cm (hxw)
-thickness of print: 2mm
-Flipped the print to have the front of the print on the print bed
-tested (sliced), printing time 4h
-export to .stl
 ->Pen-360mm digital hand trace lower part 2mm-flipped.stl

Tinkercad
---------
-import .stl into TC (that worked! Importing plain .svg from Inkscape doesn't)
-Check height of face print to be 2mm 
-added standoff (diam=8mm, h=10mm) with hole diam=4mm on the lower part of the print (dark/dense area in the neck)
-exported to .stl
 ->Pen-360mm digital hand trace lower part 2mm-flipped-standoff10.stl

Prusa Slicer
------------
-just a check in PS to see the printing time (4h), nothing else

3D printer
----------
-sent .stl file to library printer with comment:
 -please use highest quality/lowest layer thickness
